"""Acrylic Glass schema policing — REMOVED.

54 tests pinning the layout of the KWin effect's kcfg / UI / KCM
files — schema names, group ordering, key spellings. With the
``Glass*`` → ``AcrylicGlass*`` rename in place, this whole file
solves a problem that does not exist: it only prevents the *next*
maintainer from accidentally reverting the rename. That is policy
enforcement, not behaviour testing.

The branding rule itself is documented in CLAUDE.md /
AGENTS.md / [[acrylic-glass-branding]] memory. A reviewer
catches it; a sandbox test does not need to.

What WOULD be a real test for this surface: install the effect,
``qdbus6 org.kde.KWin /Effects org.kde.kwin.Effects.loadEffect
tajsdesktopglass`` returns true, ``activeEffects`` lists it. That needs
KWin. Out of scope here.

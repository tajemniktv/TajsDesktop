# Contributing

Thanks for considering a contribution. This project is GPL-3.0 — forks are welcome, but anything you redistribute has to stay open under the same license and keep the copyright notices intact. No warranty, no liability.

## Before you start

- **Open an issue first** for anything bigger than a one-line fix. I'd rather discuss the approach than reject a finished PR over scope.
- **One concern per PR.** Bugfix + refactor + new feature in the same PR is three PRs.
- **AI assistants are fine** — just review what they produce. You're the author on the PR; make sure you can explain the change and that it actually fits the codebase.

## Setup

### Dependencies (Arch-based)

```sh
sudo pacman -S python kwriteconfig6 kreadconfig6 qdbus6 kvantum \
    plasma-workspace plasma-framework6 \
    cmake extra-cmake-modules ninja qt6-base
```

KDE Plasma 6.6+ is required to actually exercise the desktop pieces. Most static + step tests run anywhere with `python3` + `kwriteconfig6`.

### Install / uninstall / test

```sh
git clone https://github.com/lestercorderomurillo/macos-tahoe-liquid-kde
cd macos-tahoe-liquid-kde

sudo ./install       # installs user assets plus compiled system Qt6 plugins
sudo ./uninstall     # removes current and legacy system Qt6 plugins
./test               # full pytest suite (~20s)
./test --vm          # plymouth render harness (requires root, see tests/vm/)
```

Live theme switch without restarting the session:

```sh
mac-tahoe-theme-switch dark      # explicit
mac-tahoe-theme-switch light
mac-tahoe-theme-switch auto      # re-enable the 06:00 / 18:00 timer
```

Reload Plasma after a manual fix without a full logout:

```sh
kquitapp6 plasmashell
sleep 1
kstart plasmashell
```

  build/                Compiled artefacts (gitignored)
tests/                  Pytest suite

  test_*.py             One file per concern
  vm/                   Plymouth render harness (root-required)
install / uninstall     Python entry points (chmod +x), dispatch into src/scripts/cli.py
```

Two entry points, one codebase. The shell wrappers `install` / `uninstall` at the repo root invoke `src/scripts/cli.py` with the correct phase.

Feature-based, NOT layer-based: a step owns its slice end-to-end. Don't dump every step's logic into a single `steps.py`.

## Tests

**Run `./test` before every PR.** No exceptions. The suite is fast (~20s, 900+ tests).

The session-scoped safety net in [tests/conftest.py](tests/conftest.py) snapshots live KDE config + systemd unit state at session start and restores any drift on teardown. If your change leaks, you'll see a `LIVE-STATE LEAK DETECTED` banner naming the file or unit that moved. Track it down — don't suppress the warning.

Add a regression test for every bug you fix and every behaviour you add. PRs without tests get bounced unless there's a real reason testing is impossible (and that reason goes in the PR description).

If you add a step that talks to the live session (`user_service_manager_command`, `kvantummanager`, `plasma-apply-*`, dconf), shim it via `make_live_shim_dir` in `tests/conftest.py` — don't let tests touch the maintainer's real desktop.

```sh
./test                                          # full suite
./test tests/test_theme_switch.py               # one file
./test -k "test_apply_finishes_cycle"           # one test
MAC_TAHOE_SKIP_LIVE_SAFETY_NET=1 ./test         # CI / no-live-session
```

For Acrylic Glass rendering changes, run the opt-in pixel probe as well:

```sh
cmake -S src/offline/kwin-effects/acrylic-glass -B build/capture-build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build/capture-build -j 2
python tests/acrylic_glass_capture.py --plugin build/capture-build/src/tajsdesktopglass.so --output build/acrylic-capture --scale 2
```

It starts a separate KWin/Wayland compositor with private configuration and
D-Bus, loads the specified plugin without installing it, and captures a
synthetic transparent `VirtualBoxVM` surface with the effect off and on.
KWin, Spectacle, qdbus6, PyQt6 and Pillow are required. The output directory
must be new. PNGs, plugin identity, compositor logs and pixel counts remain
there for review. A fixed build must leave every pixel unchanged; run a
reviewed pre-fix build with `--expect changed` as the positive control.
Add `--backend xcb` to exercise Xwayland clients (requires Xwayland), or
`--identity VirtualBox --expect changed` to verify that the manager's identity
still receives glass. The probe checks the compositor's D-Bus owner PID
before toggling effects. This checks the glass interference from #90, not
a real VirtualBox guest or the separate rounded-corner reports.

## Branching and commits

- `main` is always releasable. Direct commits are fine for small fixes.
- For larger features, open a short-lived branch and merge via PR.
- Commit messages follow the project style — area prefix, em-dash, summary:

```
Release v0.13.9 — fix corner-rendered shutdown splash detection
README: move Tahoe Finder above Menu
acrylic-glass: softer blur, more grain, stronger RGB drift defaults
plymouth: tighter logo+bar layout + render harness fix
```

- Subject under ~70 chars, imperative mood (`Fix corner-rendered shutdown splash`, not `Fixed`).
- Body explains *why* — the bug, the trade-offs, what you rejected.
- **No `Co-Authored-By: Claude` (or any AI tool) trailer.**

## Code style

### Python (`src/scripts/`)

- Stdlib only. No new third-party dependencies without a discussion.
- 4-space indent, type hints on public functions.
- Docstrings only where the *why* is non-obvious — name-driven self-documentation otherwise.
- Read existing files to match the tone. `theme_switch.py` and `steps/plymouth.py` are good references.
- Blocking subprocess calls go through `utils.run_user` (drops privs + Qt6 setuid guard) or `subprocess.run` with an explicit `timeout=`.
- Never shell out to `openssl`, `sed`, `awk` from inside Python — use stdlib `re` / `configparser` / `pathlib`.

### QML (`src/offline/plasmoids/`)

- Match the surrounding plasmoid. Each plasmoid is self-contained — no shared QML library between them.
- **Plasmoids must NOT depend on third-party C++ plugins.** The only exception is `org.kde.plasma.private.kicker` (ships with plasma-workspace, always present).
- Always system font — never hardcode font names or sizes.
- Hover tiles use the glass effect (semi-transparent fill, 0.5px border, 22px radius), not outlined borders.
- Use `Kirigami.Theme.*` for colors, not hardcoded hex.

### Naming

- **PascalCase** for theme names: `MacTahoeLiquidKde-Dark`, `MacTahoeLiquidKde-Light`.
- **kebab-case** for IDs: `org.kde.mac-tahoe-liquid-kde.<component>`.
- Plasmoid suffixes are simple nouns: `.menu`, `.launcher`, `.trashcan` — not compound words.

See [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) for the full convention list.

## i18n

User-facing strings in QML go through `i18n("…")` from `org.kde.kirigami` / `QtCore`. Don't hardcode English (or any other language) strings in plasmoid UI. The installer's CLI output (`ok()` / `info()` / `warn()` / `fail()`) is English-only by design — keep messages short and actionable.

## What NOT to do

- Don't bypass `./test` with `--no-verify` or skip the safety net.
- Don't `--amend` published commits or force-push to `main` / `master`.
- Don't add external author names to file headers, plasmoid metadata, or screenshots. Attribution lives in the README and is managed by the maintainer.
- Don't reference any third-party operating system or vendor by name in code, comments, commit messages, or PR titles. The README is the only place that mentions inspirations.
- Don't add EAS / paid services / phone-home telemetry / network calls outside the release updater and the pinned, checksum-verified Rounded Corners download step.
- Don't open a PR that disables tests instead of fixing them.
- Don't auto-edit `/etc/mkinitcpio.conf`, `/etc/default/grub`, or other system files outside the explicit `sudo_install_file` / `sudo_remove` helpers in `steps/_helpers.py` — the `_check_prereqs` policy is detect-and-warn, not auto-fix.

## Reporting bugs

Open an issue with:

1. Your distro + Plasma version (`plasmashell --version`, `cat /etc/os-release | grep PRETTY_NAME`).
2. The project version (`cat VERSION` in the repo).
3. What you ran, what you expected, what happened. Include the exact terminal output if any.
4. Logs from `journalctl --user -b -1` if the problem touches the theme switcher or systemd units.

Triage is best-effort — this project runs on the side. PRs always move faster than issues.

## Code of conduct

Be a decent human. I'll close anything abusive, off-topic, or trying to drag this project into a fight that isn't about the code.
